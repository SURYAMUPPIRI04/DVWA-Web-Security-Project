# DVWA-Web-Security-Project
## Project Overview
The **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** project is designed to demonstrate common security vulnerabilities in web applications. It includes multiple security tests, such as **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, allowing users to learn how these vulnerabilities work and how to mitigate them.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SURYAMUPPIRI04/DVWA-Web-Security-Project.git

## Install the necessary software
Apache or Nginx web server

MySQL Database
DVWA-specific dependencies (found in the requirements.txt file)

Set up the environment:
Copy the config.inc.php.dist file to config.inc.php.
Update the database credentials in the config.inc.php file.

## Start the web server and database

## Testing Information
This repository contains various files for testing the following vulnerabilities:
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Test how SQL injections work and how they can be prevented.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Explore how XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Learn how CSRF attacks can be executed.

Please refer to the corresponding test files for detailed information on each vulnerability type.
