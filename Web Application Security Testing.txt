# 🔐 Web Application Security Testing – DVWA Project

This project is a hands-on exploration of common web application vulnerabilities using **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**. The goal is to understand how real-world attacks work and how to mitigate them through ethical hacking practices.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- XAMPP – Local server (Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- DVWA – Vulnerable web app for security training
- Burp Suite – Manual testing and request manipulation
- OWASP ZAP – Automated vulnerability scanner
- Web Browser (Chrome/Firefox)
- Kali Linux (optional)
- GitHub for documentation

## 🛠️ Vulnerabilities Exploited

| Vulnerability | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **SQL Injection (SQLi)** | Bypassed SQL logic using `' OR '1'='1` to dump all user data |
| **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** | Injected malicious `<script>` tag into message form to trigger JavaScript |
| **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** | Simulated an attack using a malicious image tag to silently change passwords |
